	Abstract = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

@Inbook{speechrec,
abstract     = {<p>The task of speech recognition is to convert speech into a sequence of words
                by a computer program. As the most natural communication modality for humans, the
                ultimate dream of speech recognition is to enable people to communicate more
                naturally and effectively. While the long-term objective requires deep
                integration with many NLP components discussed in this book, there are many
                emerging applications that can be readily deployed with the core speech
                recognition module we will review in this chapter. Some of these typical
                applications include voice dialing, call routing, data entry and dictation,
                command and control, and computer-aided language learning. In this chapter, we
                provide an overview in Section II of the main components in speech recognition,
                followed by a critical review of the historically significant developments in the
                field in Section III. We devote Sections IV to speech recognition applications,
                including some recent case studies. An in-depth analysis of current state of
                speech recognition and detailed discussions on a number of future research
                directions in speech recognition are presented in Sections V.</p>},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},
