\subsection{Jian Version}
In recent years, \textit{word embeddings} \citep{word2vec13,glove14,fasttext18} have brought large improvements to a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) \citep{collins16,drqa17}.
By encoding words as low-dimensional dense vectors, word embeddings allow NLP tasks to be framed as pattern recognition problems over dense continuous spaces, which can then be tackled using the powerful machinery of neural networks.
However, these word embeddings can occupy a very large amount of memory, making it impractical to deploy them to memory-constrained environments like smart phones.
To this end, it is of great importance to decrease the amount of memory occupied by the embeddings for massive deployment.


Designing simple embedding compression methods with both strong empirical performance and provable guarantees is challenging.
For example, the current state-of-the-art methods for compressing word embeddings are deep learning-based approaches, such as deep compositional code \citep{dccl17} and K-way discrete code \citep{chen2018learning}. In these methods, the compression are achieved by training a neural network architectures to represent each word as a sum of vectors from learned dictionaries.


In this work, we revisit a compression method based on simple uniform quantization, and analyze the impact of quantization on generalization performance in the case of linear regression models.
The quantization-based approach has two parts: By using golden section search, we find the optimal threshold at which to clip the extreme values in the word embedding matrix. We then uniformly quantize the clipped embeddings within the clipped interval. Based on these two steps, this simple approach can achieve fast compression without computationally expensive training or extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Empirically, we demonstrate that uniform quantization can match the performance of the more complex baselines across a variety of tasks, embedding types, and compression rates.
On the machine reading comprehension task, we evaluate different embeddings with DrQA model \cite{drqa17} using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) \citep{squad16}. Uniform quantization can attain 32x compression for GloVe and fastText embeddings, while on average attaining F1 scores within 0.45\% and \todo{XX\%} absolute of the full-precision embeddings, respectively. To evaluate on more NLP applications with various model architecture, we also show that quantized embeddings matche the generalization performance of embeddings compressed with state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, across 7 sentiment analysis, 2 word similarity and 2 analogy tasks. 

We theoretically show that the quantization has negligible effect on generalization in important schemes when quantization error is relatively small comparing to regularization strength. Specifically we work in the case of linear regression, which is a simplified model of regression and ranking-based NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our analysis reveals that when the spectrum of the word embedding matrix decays slowly (which we empirically observe to be true), strong regularization has minimally impact on generalization performance. Thus uniformly quantized embeddings can have similar generalization performance to that of uncompressed full precision embeddings.

In recent years, \textit{word embeddings} \citep{word2vec13,glove14,fasttext18} have brought large improvements to a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) \citep{collins16,drqa17}.
By encoding words as low-dimensional dense vectors, word embeddings allow NLP tasks to be framed as pattern recognition problems over dense continuous spaces, which can then be tackled using the powerful machinery of neural networks.
However, these word embeddings can occupy a very large amount of memory, making it impractical to deploy them to memory-constrained environments like smart phones.
Our goal in this work is to dramatically decrease the amount of memory occupied by the embeddings, while provably retaining strong performance on downstream tasks.

Designing a compression scheme which is capable of retaining strong performance at low memory budgets, while also being amenable to theoretical analysis, is a challenging problem.
There have been numerous important works proposing compression schemes for word embeddings and studying their empirical performance, for example using deep dictionary learning or sparse representations \citep{sparse16,andrews16,dccl17}.
Although these methods can attain large reductions in memory usage while performing well on tasks such as language modeling \citep{mikolov10} and machine translation \citep{bahdanau15}, to the best of our knowledge there exists no analysis describing the effect compression has on generalization performance for these methods.

%Designing powerful and principled compression schemes is challenging because it is unclear a priori how to model how compression affects performance.
%This is particularly true when the compression schemes being considered are complex, and when large non-convex models are employed for the downstream tasks.
%For example, the current state-of-the-art method for compressing word embeddings, called deep compositional code learning (DCCL), uses a deep architecture to represent each word as a sum of vectors from learned dictionaries \citep{dccl17}.

In this work, we show that a simple compression method based on uniform quantization can compete with the above-mentioned methods, and we bound this method's impact on the generalization performance of linear regression models.
This method has two parts: first, it determines the optimal threshold at which to clip the extreme values in the word embedding matrix.
It then uniformly quantizes the clipped embeddings within the clipped interval.
This algorithm is easy to implement, has no hyperparameters, and runs in seconds on a single CPU core.

Empirically, we demonstrate that this method can match the performance of the state-of-the-art compression schemes on question answering, sentiment analysis, and word analogy and similarity tasks, for both GloVe \citep{glove14} and fastText \citep{fasttext18} embeddings.
On the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) \citep{squad16}, for example, it attains a compression ratio of 32x with an average F1 score only 0.47\% absolute below the full-precision GloVe embeddings, while the deep dictionary learning method of \citet{dccl17} is 0.43\% below.

Theoretically, we show in the context of linear ridge regression that quantization has a negligible effect on generalization performance when the quantization noise is small relative to the regularization parameter.
Furthermore, we show that when the spectrum of the word embedding matrix decays slowly (which we empirically observe to be true), a large regularizer, and thus low-precision, will perform similarly to the full-precision embeddings.
Importantly, our analysis is not specific to word embeddings; it directly extends to any setting in which a linear model is being learned over a uniformly quantized representation.
