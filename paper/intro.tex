In recent years, \textit{word embeddings} \citep{word2vec13,glove14,fasttext18} have brought large improvements to a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) \citep{collins16,drqa17}.
By encoding words as low-dimensional dense vectors, word embeddings allow NLP tasks to be framed as pattern recognition problems over dense continuous spaces, which can then be tackled using the powerful machinery of neural networks.
However, these word embeddings can occupy a very large amount of memory, making it expensive to deploy them in data centers, and impractical to use them in memory-constrained environments like smart phones.
Thus, compressing these embeddings is an important problem.


Designing simple and fast embedding compression methods with strong empirical performance is challenging.
There have been numerous important works proposing compression schemes for word embeddings and studying their empirical performance \citep{sparse16,andrews16,dccl17,kway18};
for example, current state-of-the-art methods train neural network models to represent each word as a sum of vectors from learned dictionaries \citep{dccl17,kway18}.
Although these methods can attain strong performance on a range of natural language processing tasks such as language modeling \citep{mikolov10} and machine translation \citep{bahdanau15}, designing and training the neural network for compression can be time-consuming.

Empirically, we demonstrate that this uniform quantization method can match the performance of the state-of-the-art compression schemes on question answering, sentiment analysis, and word analogy and similarity tasks, for both GloVe \citep{glove14} and fastText \citep{fasttext18} embeddings.
Using the DrQA model \citep{drqa17} on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) \citep{squad16}, for example, it attains a compression ratio of 32x with an average F1 score only 0.47\% absolute below the uncompressed GloVe embeddings, while the state-of-the-art deep compositional code learning method \cite{dccl17} is 0.43\% below.

Theoretically, we work on understanding a critical question regarding embedding quantization given a fixed memory budget to store embedding matrices --- {to optimize downstream task performance, should we quantize a higher dimensional uncompressed embedding to lower precision, or should we quantize a lower dimensional uncompressed embedding to higher precision.} Specifically, we analyze generalization bounds in the case of linear ridge regression using word embeddings.
Our analysis reveals that one can optimize down stream performance under the fixed memory budget following a two-steps principle. In the first step, we show an optimal dimensionality exists as a consequence of the bias-variance trade-off in generalization performance. In the second step, we show quantization can have negligible impact on the generalization bound when the uncompressed embedding has a slow-decaying spectrum (empirically observed to be true). Thus under limit memory budgets, one should use the lowest quantization precision until the quantized embedding reaches the optimal dimensionality for the uncompressed counter-part. 



%Theoretically, we show in the context of linear ridge regression that quantization has a negligible effect on generalization performance when the quantization noise is small relative to the regularization parameter.
%Furthermore, we show that when the spectrum of the word embedding matrix decays slowly (which we empirically observe to be true), strong regularization has minimal impact on generalization performance.
%Combined, these two results imply that the uniformly quantized embeddings can have similar generalization performance to the uncompressed embeddings at high compression rates.

%In recent years, \textit{word embeddings} \citep{word2vec13,glove14,fasttext18} have brought large improvements to a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) \citep{collins16,drqa17}.
%By encoding words as low-dimensional dense vectors, word embeddings allow NLP tasks to be framed as pattern recognition problems over dense continuous spaces, which can then be tackled using the powerful machinery of neural networks.
%However, these word embeddings can occupy a very large amount of memory, making it expensive to deploy in the data center, and impractical to deploy them to memory-constrained environments like smart phones.
%Thus, it is important to decrease the amount of memory occupied by the embeddings for massive deployment.
%
%Designing embedding compression methods with both strong empirical performance and provable bounds on generalization performance is challenging.
%For example, the current state-of-the-art methods for compressing word embeddings are deep learning-based approaches, such as deep compositional code \citep{dccl17} and K-way discrete code \citep{chen2018learning}. In these methods, the compression are achieved by training a neural network architectures to represent each word as a sum of vectors from learned dictionaries.
%
%
%In this work, we revisit a compression method based on simple uniform quantization, and analyze the impact of quantization on generalization performance in the case of linear regression models.
%The quantization-based approach has two parts: By using golden section search, we find the optimal threshold at which to clip the extreme values in the word embedding matrix. We then uniformly quantize the clipped embeddings within the clipped interval. Based on these two steps, this simple approach can achieve fast compression without computationally expensive training or extensive hyperparameter tuning.
%
%Empirically, we demonstrate that uniform quantization can match the performance of the more complex baselines across a variety of tasks, embedding types, and compression rates.
%On the machine reading comprehension task, we evaluate different embeddings with DrQA model \cite{drqa17} using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) \citep{squad16}. Uniform quantization can attain 32x compression for GloVe and fastText embeddings, while on average attaining F1 scores within 0.45\% and \todo{XX\%} absolute of the full-precision embeddings, respectively. To evaluate on more NLP applications with various model architecture, we also show that quantized embeddings matche the generalization performance of embeddings compressed with state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, across 7 sentiment analysis, 2 word similarity and 2 analogy tasks. 
%
%We theoretically show that the quantization has negligible effect on generalization in important schemes when quantization error is relatively small comparing to regularization strength. Specifically we work in the case of linear regression, which is a simplified model of regression and ranking-based NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our analysis reveals that when the spectrum of the word embedding matrix decays slowly (which we empirically observe to be true), strong regularization has minimally impact on generalization performance. Thus uniformly quantized embeddings can have similar generalization performance to that of uncompressed full precision embeddings.

%However, these word embeddings can occupy a very large amount of memory, making it impractical to deploy them to memory-constrained environments like smart phones.
%Our goal in this work is to dramatically decrease the amount of memory occupied by the embeddings, while provably retaining strong performance on downstream tasks.
%
%Designing a compression scheme which is capable of retaining strong performance at low memory budgets, while also being amenable to theoretical analysis, is a challenging problem.
%There have been numerous important works proposing compression schemes for word embeddings and studying their empirical performance, for example using deep dictionary learning or sparse representations \citep{sparse16,andrews16,dccl17}.

%
%%Designing powerful and principled compression schemes is challenging because it is unclear a priori how to model how compression affects performance.
%%This is particularly true when the compression schemes being considered are complex, and when large non-convex models are employed for the downstream tasks.
%%For example, the current state-of-the-art method for compressing word embeddings, called deep compositional code learning (DCCL), uses a deep architecture to represent each word as a sum of vectors from learned dictionaries \citep{dccl17}.
%
%In this work, we show that a simple compression method based on uniform quantization can compete with the above-mentioned methods, and we bound this method's impact on the generalization performance of linear regression models.
%This method has two parts: first, it determines the optimal threshold at which to clip the extreme values in the word embedding matrix.
%It then uniformly quantizes the clipped embeddings within the clipped interval.
%This algorithm is easy to implement, has no hyperparameters, and runs in seconds on a single CPU core.

%Furthermore, we show that when the spectrum of the word embedding matrix decays slowly (which we empirically observe to be true), a large regularizer, and thus low-precision, will perform similarly to the full-precision embeddings.
%Importantly, our analysis is not specific to word embeddings; it directly extends to any setting in which a linear model is being learned over a uniformly quantized representation.
