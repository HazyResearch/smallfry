\subsection{Eigenspace Overlap}
\label{subsec:eigen_overlap}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduce the eigenspace overlap metric.
%		\item Present the generalization bound.
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Generalization of Compressed Embeddings}
\label{subsec:revisit}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Empirically demonstrate the correlation with respect to generalization performance
		\item Discuss why it explains better than Deltas (if have not discuss the relation to Deltas, we should discuss here also).
	\end{itemize}
