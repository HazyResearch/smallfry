In recent years, \textit{word embeddings} \citep{word2vec13,glove14,fasttext18} have brought large improvements to a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) \citep{collins16,drqa17}.
However, these word embeddings can occupy a very large amount of memory, making it expensive to deploy them in data centers, and impractical to use them in memory-constrained environments like smart phones. %\citep{reference?}.
Thus, compressing these embeddings is an important problem.

While there have been numerous successful methods proposed recently for compressing embeddings \citep{sparse16,andrews16,dccl17,kway18}, these methods share a couple of important shortcomings.
First, these methods are generally quite computationally expensive and training them requires tuning many hyperparameters, costing valuable computation and developer time to use.
The current state-of-the-art methods, for example, train neural network models to represent each word as a sum of vectors from learned dictionaries \citep{dccl17,kway18}.
Second, these methods lack theoretical guarantees for determining when compression is likely to produce embeddings which perform well.
This makes it difficult for practitioners to confidently use these methods without extensive downstream verification.

In this work, we address both of these shortcomings.
First, we show that a simple and fast compression method based on uniform quantization can empirically compete with the state-of-the-art methods, while being orders of magnitude faster and requiring no hyperparameter tuning.
This method can compress a large embedding matrix in less than a minute on a single CPU core.
Second, we present generalization bounds for our compressed embeddings, revealing settings where strong generalization performance is guaranteed.

%Second, we present theoretical guarantees for our method, building on recent work in kernel ridge regression to understand how compression affects generalization performance in the context of linear ridge regression \citep{avron17,lprff18}.

%\citet{lprff18} define a notion of approximation between matrices called $(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)$-spectral approximation, and we show that when the compressed embedding is close to the uncompressed embedding in this sense, they are guaranteed to attain similar generalization performance.

Empirically, we demonstrate that our compression method can match the performance of the state-of-the-art compression schemes on a variety of tasks and compression ratios.
We evaluate performance on question answering, sentiment analysis, and word analogy and similarity tasks, for both GloVe \citep{glove14} and fastText \citep{fasttext18} embeddings.
We observe that across tasks, our compression method can attain 32x compression within \todo{XX\%}-\todo{YY\%} performance relative to those attained by the state-of-the-art deep composition code learning (DCCL) approach~\citep{dccl17}.
%with \todo{XX\%}-\todo{YY\%} absolute performance loss, while DCCL attains \todo{XX\%}-\todo{YY\%}.
As an example, using the DrQA model \citep{drqa17} on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) \citep{squad16}, uniform quantization attains a compression ratio of 32x with an average F1 score only 0.47\% absolute below the uncompressed GloVe embeddings, while the DCCL performance is 0.43\% below at the same compression rate.

Theoretically, we analyze the generalization performance for our compressed embeddings in the context of linear ridge regression, revealing settings where the compressed embeddings are guaranteed to match the performance of the uncompressed ones.
Specifically, we leverage a recent notion of spectral approximation between matrices \citep{avron17,lprff18}, and show that when the compressed embeddings are a close approximation to the uncompressed ones, strong generalization performance is guaranteed.
We then show that our method will with high probability produce embeddings which are a close spectral approximation of the uncompressed embeddings, if the number of bits per matrix entry is chosen appropriately.
This analysis provides a sufficient condition---close spectral approximation---for guaranteeing strong performance.
Though our analysis is specific to linear ridge regression, we believe this is an important first step toward understanding compression's impact on generalization, and hope this work inspires further analysis.

%First, these compression methods are generally quite computationally expensive and require tuning many hyperparameters.

%This absence of a framework makes it difficult to predict how a compressed embedding will perform without running a full downstream evaluation.
%%In addition to being expensive to train and tune, these compression schemes are difficult to analyze; for example, no guarantees exist for when the algorithms will produce embeddings with strong downstream performance.
%
%
%

%Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework 
%%This compression scheme is also amenable to theoretical analysis;
%%we present conditions under which the quantized embeddings will perform on par with the uncompressed embeddings in the context of linear ridge regression.
%%we show that the spectrum of the word embedding matrix plays an important role in determining whether its compressed representation will perform well, with slow spectral decay being more amenable to quantization.

%
%Theoretically, we show that quantization has a negligible effect on generalization performance when the quantization noise is small relative to the regularization parameter, in the context of linear ridge regression.
%Furthermore, we show that when the spectrum of the word embedding matrix decays slowly, strong regularization has minimal impact on generalization performance.
%Combined, these two results imply that when a word embedding matrix has a slow spectral decay (which we empirically observe to be true), it's quantized representation will perform similarly to the uncompressed embeddings at high compression rates.

%Although these methods can attain strong performance on a range of NLP tasks such as language modeling \citep{mikolov10} and machine translation \citep{bahdanau15}, 
%designing and training the neural networks for compression can be labor-intensive and computationally expensive.
%Furthermore, the complexity of these compression methods makes it difficult to analyze the impact that compression has on the downstream performance of the embeddings.

%In this work, we show that a simple compression method based on uniform quantization can empirically compete with the state-of-the-art methods, and we present generalization bounds for the quantized embeddings for linear regression models.
%The compression method has two parts: first, it determines the optimal threshold at which to clip the extreme values in the word embedding matrix using golden section search \citep{golden53}.

%We demonstrate that when choosing the dimension of word embeddings there is a bias-variance trade-off, and that there can thus an optimal dimension; although this phenomenon has been observed \citep{landauer97} and analyzed \citep{yin18} previously, this explanation provides a novel perspective.
%We then analyze how quantization impacts generalization performance; we show that quantized embeddings can attain comparable generalization performance to full-precision embeddings at high compression rates when the spectrum of the embedding matrix decays slowly (which we empirically observe to be true).
